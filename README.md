# Dementia: EDA and Suggetsed Predictive Models
## Introduction

## Problem Statement

## Data

## Plan

## Use Case

## Notebook
Creating pipelines with Pycaret, EDA with Pandas and Modeling with Scikit-learn.

This project will illustrate using [Pycaret 3](https://pycaret.org/) to develop a predictive model pipeline and ten recreate with [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). The main focus are: classcification, regression, and clustering.

# Plan
