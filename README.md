# Alzheimer's Disease: Data Science Approach

## Introduction
Artificial intelligence and machine learning-based approaches and applications can be used to improve healthcare solutions and reducing cost. Applying technology in healthcare can accelerate the field's progression, including increased speed of diagnosis, accuracy, and simplicity.

In this project, I will apply data science to look at Alzheimer's Disease and suggest some predictive models using for diagnosis.


## Problem Statement
- [Alhzeimer's Disease (AD)](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/aginginfo/alzheimers.htm) is a neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common cause of dementia (accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases).
- AD is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States. The cost of treatment is high and [death rates](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db116.pdf) are increasing over years. AD worsens over time and has no cure. Detecting AD at early stage can help in preventing it from developing and delay its onset.
- My goal in this project is to use machine learning techniques to build models that can be helpful in predicting early stage AD.

## Plan
1. EDA using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [ydata_profiling](https://pypi.org/project/ydata-profiling/)
2. Data Cleaning using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
3. Create predictive models with [Pycaret 3](https://pycaret.org/) and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Discusion

Extra Tree, XGboost, Random Forest: take only one feature (CDR) as the most important and perform very well thank to the colinerity. CDR is an important feature in most of predictive models. The fact that this cognitive test is easy to administer and takes less than an hour to complete, making it a practical tool for use in clinical settings. The downside of this test is it does not take into account the individualâ€™s social, cultural, and personal circumstances, which may affect their cognitive functioning. Therefore, even though those model hit a very high score with all F1, accuracy and precision, I personally think it is overfitting.


LDA and LighGBM: consider more features when perform the prediction (...). Regardless a little bit lower scores, I personally think those models will give us more reasonable prediction since it can balance the downside of CDR test. We know that features like age, gender can also effect the brain volume. Also, subject's education level or socialeconomic status can also have different approach to the cognitive tests.

This subset has some repeated records (2-5 for each patients) with the same background information (Socialeconomic Status, Education, Gender), only different in age may cause some kind of colinearity.

Even though machine learning can be very helpful in the medical fields, one of the most important risks of machine learning-based algorithms is the reliance on the probabilistic distribution and the probability of error in diagnosis and prediction.
