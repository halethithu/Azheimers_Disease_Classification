# Alzheimer's Disease: Data Science Approach

## Introduction
Artificial intelligence and machine learning-based approaches and applications can be used to improve healthcare solutions and reducing cost. Applying technology in healthcare can accelerate the field's progression, including increased speed of diagnosis, accuracy, and simplicity.

In this project, I will apply data science to look at Alzheimer's Disease and suggest some predictive models using for diagnosis. 

## Problem Statement
- [Alhzeimer's Disease (AD)](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/aginginfo/alzheimers.htm) is a neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common cause of dementia (accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases).
- AD worsens over time and has no cure. Detecting AD at early stage can help in preventing it from developing and delay its onset.
- My goal in this project is use machine learning techniques to build models that can be helpful in predicting early stage AD.

## Plan
1. EDA using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
2. Data Cleaning using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
3. Create predictive models with [Pycaret 3](https://pycaret.org/) and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


## Discusion

<i>(Positive discusion will be here when I actually have some conclusions out of my works)</i>

Even though machine learning can be very helpful in the medical fields, one of the most important risks of machine learning-based algorithms is the reliance on the probabilistic distribution and the probability of error in diagnosis and prediction.
