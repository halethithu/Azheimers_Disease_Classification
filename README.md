# Alzheimer's Disease: EDA and Suggetsed Predictive Models
## Introduction


## Problem Statement
- [Alhzeimer's Disease (AD)](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers) is a neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common cause of dementia (accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases).
- AD worsens over time and has no cure. Detecting AD at early stage can help in preventing it from developing and delay its onset.
- My goal in this project is:
1. Visualize some key features of AD base on available data on this subject
2. Use machine learning techniques to build (a) models that can be helpful in predicting early stage AD based on MRI image of brain tissue.

## Data

## Plan
1. EDA using Python (Pandas and Seaborn)
2. Data Cleaning using Python (Pandas) or/and SQL
3. Create pipelines with [Pycaret 3](https://pycaret.org/) and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
4. Data Visualization with Power BI
